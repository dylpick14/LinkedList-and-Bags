LinkedList-and-Bags
This project was part of my Data Structures class. This project focuses on LinkedLists or "Bags" in terms of the code. The BagExtensionsTest.java and the BagInterface.java classes were given by the professor. The LinkedBag.java had the default constructor and party of the overloaded constructor filled in by the professor. All other functions were written by me.

What the functions do:
1. Checking to see if two bags are equal to each other
2. Duplicate all entities in a bag
3. Remove all duplicate entities in a bag
4. Check to see if the bag is empty
5. gets the current size of the bag
6. adds a new entry to the linked list
7. sets all entries in the linked list bag into an array
8. get the frequency of an entry in a particular bag
9. remove an entry
10. gets the reference location to the node of a particular entry if located
11. clears out a bag
12. removing a random node (Never Completed)
